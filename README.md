# The Criterion Benchmarking Suite

> Evaluating Immutable Collections across Java Virtual Machine Languages and Libraries

Criterion is a benchmarking library that facilitates cross-language comparisons of persistent data structures, supporting Scala's immutable collections, Clojure's built-in data structures, and several collections libraries in the Java ecosystem. 

To our knowledge, Criterion is the first elaborate benchmarking attempt to benchmark immutable collection data structures across different library and language barriers.
